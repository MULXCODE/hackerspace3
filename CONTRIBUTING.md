# How to contribute

To contribute, we encourage you to create useful Issues for us to work on,
either bug reports or feature requests.

If you're feeling more adventurous, take a look about our [good first
issue](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
list, for some issues that may be easy for new contributors to help with.

Please [sign off](#sign-off) your contributions.

## Sign off

A Sign-Off helps us to keep a written record that authors of contributions
agree to release them under our project's [license](LICENSE). We've adopted the
DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin: http://developercertificate.org/) for
this purpose:
